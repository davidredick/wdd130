        The people who will be visiting my site will be residents of my hometown, business owners, media outlets, and others interested in my campaign for city council.

The visitors of my site will expect me to provide them with a sense of my standing on a variety of subjects that are important to them and the community to which we all belong.  

Activities that visitors can expect to complete on my site will be to read about me, and my standing on a variety of subjects and hot-button issues for the community at large.  They will have the opportunity to sign up for my weekly newsletter, and or weekly text.  There will be a chance for them to donate to my campaign as well as a form that they can fill out to get involved in any way that they can

There will be nothing required to access my site and view the content.  There will be opportunities to share information to gain more information and provide support.  

They will come to my site to gain information and insights that cannot be obtained in any other format besides in person.

About me:

I have been a Washingtonian for my entire life.  I was raised by loving parents who taught me that by standing upright and working hard you can do anything that you set your mind to.    
Work is a fundamental cornerstone to any community.  It starts with the individual, going to work and taking care of their responsibilities. Putting in a day’s work and getting paid a fair market wage for that work.  
It has grown to the community whether it be a neighborhood, a religious group, a support group or any other community that you choose to belong.  By working together as a community, we are able to lift up our fellow members of the community we belong first, then if there is any excess we can provide for those outside of our immediate community that belong to the community at large.  This is lots of hard work and in my experience the “return on investment” is 10-fold.  By working hard and serving in your community we all are able to lift one another’s burdens and make them lighter.
I have been blessed to be married to the love of my life and the queen In our home.  We have been married for almost 15 blessed years.  WE have also been blessed with two precocious boys that are the apples in our eye.

      <h3>Goals for the Community</h3>
      <p>
        Goals for the Community:
As a resident for Aberdeen for the last 3 years, I have become disillusioned by the rampant petty crime and exploding homelessness plaguing our community. The dilapidation of our downtown with the lack of governmental support to attract businesses of all sizes.  
We know that the backbone of our economy is the small business. I am not aware of any incentives on the books to attract those fledgling startups to our humble town. 
Why are we not working toward making our community attractive to those medium to large corporations that if they join our community would provide a greater tax base and assist the local government with growing our community and not just keeping it stagnated.

Aberdeen was established as a working community and my goal is to bring back businesses that have left us because they felt it was not a favorable situation to be in.
