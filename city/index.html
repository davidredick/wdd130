                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>I had the great opportunity to move to this great city with my family just over 3 years ago and fell in love with the community.
                    <br><br>I have been blessed with a great abundance in my life.  With the receipt of these blessings I am driven to give back. 
                    <br><br>One way I can do that is to take the leadership skills that I have gained over my life and share them with my community.
                    <br><br>I am saddened that the world at large and our humble town has decided to leave the course of right and do what is necessary to bring our community back to its glory days of great employment and a thriving economy.
                    <br><br>Unfortunately due to a coherent plan from the leadership of our little town I am obligated to throw my name into the had so I can assist to bring us back off the cliff.
                </p>
