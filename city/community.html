                <h2>Goals for the Community</h2>
                <p>Goals for the Community: As a resident for Aberdeen for the last 3 years, I have become disillusioned by the rampant petty crime and exploding homelessness plaguing our community. 
                    <br><br>The dilapidation of our downtown with the lack of governmental support to attract businesses of all sizes. We know that the backbone of our economy is the small business. I am not aware of any incentives on the books to attract those fledgling startups to our humble town. 
                    <br><br>Why are we not working toward making our community attractive to those medium to large corporations that if they join our community would provide a greater tax base and assist the local government with growing our community and not just keeping it stagnated. 
                    <br><br>Aberdeen was established as a working community and my goal is to bring back businesses that have left us because they felt it was not a favorable situation to be in.</p>
